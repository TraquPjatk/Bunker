# Bunker
DayZ custom location

&nbsp;♦ Message me if noticed any lightning bugs on discord "Traqu"  
  
&nbsp;♦ MapGroupPos is poluted with `bldr | vbldr | StacitObj` classes objects.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;♦ Few of Land class objects do not spawn loot whatsoever (Land_underground_exit, etc.)  
  
&nbsp;♦ Eastern / oceanSide outer rock slope has still some darkness leaks  

&nbsp;♦ Northern Witch's Cave exit has some oddly behaving lightning transitions (possible future fix)  

&nbsp;♦ Witch's Cave has a bug causing NVGs to behave as if they were being used during a daylight. Since the lightning level there is moderate, it might cause troubles only if a players goes there during the night and actively uses NVGs.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;♦ I am not going to fix this.  

&nbsp;♦ There are 9 book props hidden around the location. (possible prop hunt event)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;♦ Books names:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦ The Bible  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦ King Solomon's Mines  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦ The Possessed  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦ Kidnapped  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦ The Metamorphosis  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦ The Cave of Gold  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦ Crime and Punishment  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦ Robinson Crusoe  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦ The Call of Cthulhu
