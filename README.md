# Bunker
DayZ custom location

    ♦ Message me if noticed any lightning bugs on discord "Traqu"  
  
  \t♦ MapGroupPos is poluted with `bldr | vbldr | StacitObj` classes objects.  
    \t\t♦ Few of Land class objects do not spawn loot whatsoever (Land_underground_exit, etc.)  
  
  \t♦ Eastern / oceanSide outer rock slope has still some darkness leaks  

  \t♦ Northern Witch's Cave exit has some oddly behaving lightning transitions (possible future fix)  

  \t♦ Witch's Cave has a bug causing NVGs to behave as if they were being used during a daylight. Since the lightning level there is moderate, it might cause troubles only if a players goes there during the night and actively uses NVGs.   
    \t\t♦ I am not going to fix this.  

  \t♦ There are 9 book props hidden around the location. (possible prop hunt event)  
    \t\t♦ Books names:  
      \t\t\t♦ The Bible  
      \t\t\t♦ King Solomon's Mines  
      \t\t\t♦ The Possessed  
      \t\t\t♦ Kidnapped  
      \t\t\t♦ The Metamorphosis  
      \t\t\t♦ The Cave of Gold  
      \t\t\t♦ Crime and Punishment  
      \t\t\t♦ Robinson Crusoe  
      \t\t\t♦ The Call of Cthulhu
