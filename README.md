DayZ custom location

  ♦ Message me if noticed any lightning bugs on discord "Traqu"  
  
  ♦ MapGroupPos is poluted with `bldr | vbldr | StacitObj` classes objects.  
    ♦ Few of Land class objects do not spawn loot whatsoever (Land_underground_exit, etc.)  
  
  ♦ Eastern / oceanSide outer rock slope has still some darkness leaks  

  ♦ Northern Witch's Cave exit has some oddly behaving lightning transitions (possible future fix)  

  ♦ Witch's Cave has a bug causing NVGs to behave as if they were being used during a daylight. Since the lightning level there is moderate, it might cause troubles only if a players goes there during the night and actively uses NVGs.   
    ♦ I am not going to fix this.  

  ♦ There are 9 book props hidden around the location. (possible prop hunt event)  
    ♦ Books names:  
      ♦ The Bible  
      ♦ King Solomon's Mines  
      ♦ The Possessed  
      ♦ Kidnapped  
      ♦ The Metamorphosis  
      ♦ The Cave of Gold  
      ♦ Crime and Punishment  
      ♦ Robinson Crusoe  
      ♦ The Call of Cthulhu
