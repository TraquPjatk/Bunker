***DayZ custom location - Created by Traqu***

&emsp;♦ Message me if noticed any lightning bugs on discord "Traqu"  
  
&emsp;♦ MapGroupPos is poluted with _`bldr | vbldr | StacitObj`_ classes objects.  
&emsp;&emsp;♠ Few of Land class objects do not spawn loot whatsoever (Land_underground_exit, etc.)  
  
&emsp;♦ Eastern / oceanSide outer rock slope has still some darkness leaks  

&emsp;♦ Northern Witch's Cave exit has some oddly behaving lightning transitions (possible future fix)  

&emsp;♦ Witch's Cave has a bug causing NVGs to behave as if they were being used during a daylight. Since the lightning level there is moderate, it might cause troubles only if a players goes there &emsp;during the night and actively uses NVGs.   
&emsp;&emsp;♠ I am not going to fix this.  

&emsp;♦ There are 9 book props hidden around the location. (possible prop hunt event)  
&emsp;&emsp;♦ Books names:  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• The Bible  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• King Solomon's Mines  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• The Possessed  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;• Kidnapped
